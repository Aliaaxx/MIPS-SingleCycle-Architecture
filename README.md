# MIPS Single Cycle Architecture Project
This project implements a single-cycle MIPS processor architecture in Verilog, designed to execute one instruction per clock cycle. It supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set, including R-type, I-type, and J-type instructions. The design includes key components such as instruction memory, data memory, a register file, ALU, control unit, and program counter. A testbench is provided for simulation and verification.
